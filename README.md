# ULambdaC

The Untyped Lambda Calculus REPL (Acronym In Progress)

## Usage notes

This implementation follows Barendregt's convention, that is :

> "We choose the names for the binding variables in a λ-term in such a
> manner that they are all different and such that each of them differs
> from all free variables occurring in the term."
